# Stage Fright
Game Jam Fall 2015 Project by David Deschamps, Joseph Chouinard, Were Diggle, Eric Hardy and Daniel Oxman.

Amnesia-style first person horror game controlled by playing the piano.

Making use of three different keijiro Unity plugins, cause this guy's awesome: MidiJack, KinoGlitch and Retro3D.
