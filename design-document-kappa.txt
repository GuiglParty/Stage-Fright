Brainstormy ideas go here.

***************** Map *****************
- player is trapped in a maze with a monster, and has to find the exit
- spooky castle
- player has a map of the maze they can look at
	- maybe fog of war?

***************** Controls *****************
- diminished triads to run
	- move higher to turn right, lower to turn left
- press lowest keys to look behind you/ at monster
- press highest keys to look away from monster
- arpeggio up/down to go up/down stairs/ladders

***************** Monster AI *****************
- cheating Amnesia movement (spawn near player on trigger, despawn if escaped)
- chase using line-of-sight


***************** Graphics *****************
-ps1 graphics courtesy of keijiro
-might mean our wall meshes will need a few bumps to make sure we get that weird vertex shaking

- also have a few different keijiro glitch things to use:
	scan line jitter, color drift, vertical jump, horizontal shake, block damage
	use these when the player sees the monster, to further obscure it?
	or on other triggers for spooky moments
